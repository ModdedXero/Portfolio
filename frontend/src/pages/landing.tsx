                            I currently a Systems Engineer at a small tech
                            company Centriserve I.T. aspiring to be an engineer.
                            My passions lie with Software Engineering, I love
                            writing 2D and 3D games and engines in my spare time
                            {"but it's hard to get kick started in that field sadly."}
                            So what better than to become a web developer!
                            <br />
                            <strong>
                                I love C++, C#, Python, JavaScript and Node for
                                programming!

                            I do have experience. I have been working on an internal
                            website for my company for the past year building tools
                            {"to interface with API's for our management websites and"}
                            {"create reports from their data that they can't do themselves."}
                            Fun stuff right?

                            The project started as a MERN stack but I found NextJS and
                            thought it was cool so I moved it over to there.
